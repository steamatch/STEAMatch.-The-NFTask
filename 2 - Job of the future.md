# Any given dayâ€¦ soon.

After high school you got a degree.

Now you prepare to meet with your group of high school students. You are about to design a solution to a complex problem that was raised in an audio post.

The production or the productions package created by the group of students you lead is displayed in a collection of NFTs. Once published, you and your group are in charge of carrying out the promotion strategy you all planned to achieve the greatest possible participation of collectors or sponsors.

The NFTs go to an auction and the amount collected in cryptocurrencies goes to each student (many times, their first cryptocurrencies), and a percentage of each NFT auctioned goes to your crypto wallet. It is the benefit for your service as a learning tutor.

It's been your job for a while. You organize a group of students, create a work methodology,  develop a series of tasks and distribute activities according to the skills that you have discovered in each student.

They dissect the audio story, extract as much information as possible, ask questions, explore into the sources, analyze all the data collected during the investigation and discover relationships between them, construct new knowledge, and thus design a solution for the problem posed. 

You do this periodically, several times a year, with each release of a new story and a new problem to solve.
