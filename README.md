# STEAMatch: A NFTask

# The Future-verse

Let's jump into the future for an indeterminate period of time and think about some possible scenarios thanks to the crypto industry.

#### Could homework become a digital asset?

#### How would you initiate teenagers into cryptoassets management without resorting to body image, videogaming or JPGs?

#### Knowledge-based FOMO? NFTs pegged to a common creative universe to solve complex problems?

#### Could a portfolio of NFTs produced by high school students be a resource to apply for a higher education scholarship?

#### Could a donor evaluate the historical record of NFTs produced by a student, a group of students or an educational institution to measure academic performance, and thus award scholarships?

#### EduFi? KnowFi?

# Mission

You will receive a **[story](https://github.com/steamatch/STEAMatch-A-NFTask/blob/main/audio%20steamatch%20eng.mp3/)** that proposes a complex problem for which you must design a solution.

Build the best possible proposal with your STEAM skills. 

Your proposal is now a NFT, it will be auctioned and you'll be able to receive your cryptocurrencies in your [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet.

[To know the basics about NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token/).

[STEAM = STEM + Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics).

# User Manual
+ 1 A 5+ minute audio clip is posted with a story that poses a complex problem.
+ 2 Students have the possibility to produce an audio file in digital format that will be converted into an NFT.
+ 3 The NFTs are minted in the Ethereum network and displayed in a public Collection on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io).
+ 4 NFTs are subject to auction. The benefit goes to each author.

Do not rush to send your proposal. Take your time to analyze every detail of the original story. Discover all the information in the narration, the obvious and the hidden details. Explore the knowledge you can find in the questions posted in the story, and even better, ask your own questions to discover new horizons of the original story.

Remember that your NFT exists in 2 scenarios simultaneously: 
+ 1 It is what an intelligent civilization of the future will receive as a message hundreds of thousands of years from now. 
+ 2 Your production will be heard by an audience willing to incorporate it into their collection.

# NFT format
Audio track of maximum 1 minute length. Formats: MP3, OGG, WAV.

Individually or collectively, design and produce your proposal. You can be a director, screenwriter, editor or one of the voices of your own production, or you can also distribute production work into different tasks, from research to the final cut. 

Think about what audio material you would find valuable if you were an explorer from another time and space. How would our analysis of the past have changed if instead of drawings we found sound records? What if in the cave of Altamira or in the chambers of the Pyramids in Egypt we found remains of vocal expressions, conversations, speeches? Would our hypotheses of the past be different?
